# Week 3 Assignment
## Task 1: Book and Ebook Classes

### Description
- Implement a `Book` class with attributes `title`, `author`, and `pages`, along with getter and setter methods. Include a class method for calculating reading time.
- Create a subclass `Ebook` inheriting from `Book` with an additional attribute `format`. Override the `__str__()` method to display all attributes.

### Files
- `LMS.py`: Contains implementation of `Book` and `Ebook` classes.

## Task 2: File Handling

### Description
- Read data from a text file (`data.txt`) and handle exceptions such as file not found or errors during reading.
- Write user input to a new file (`output.txt`) with error handling.
- Modify the file reading function to count words and print the result.

### Files
- `file_handling.py`: Complete program for file handling tasks.

## Task 3: Math Package

### Description
- Design a Python package `math` with modules for basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations.
- Implement functions for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and square root.
- Create a script (`main.py`) to demonstrate importing and using functions from the `math` package.

### Files
- `math/`: Directory structure for `math` package.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates usage of functions from the `math` package.

## Task 4: Iterators and Generators

### Description
- Implement an iterator class `Countdown` that counts down from a given number to 1.
- Develop a generator function `fibonacci_generator` yielding Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
- Create a generator function `random_number_generator` yielding random numbers within a specified range.
- Write a Python program combining these components to demonstrate their usage.

### Files
- `iterators_generators.py`: Contains `Countdown` class, `fibonacci_generator` function, and main program demonstrating usage.
